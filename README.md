### Start Creating Transactions

In order to get the most out of Mooostachio, start by adding your beginning balance to your checking and/or savings account as a 'deposit'.

Let's say the balance in your checking account is $1,000. Add this amount, then click 'Create Entry':

Your checking account balance is now $1,000. Now you can transfer money from one category to the next. For example, if you spend $200 per week on food, you can transfer this amount to your food category at the beginning of the week:

Transfer that same amount using the 'transfer to' type:
